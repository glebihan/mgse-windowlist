INSTALLATION

./test installs the extension on your computer (in /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/)

For the extension to work:

 - It needs to be compatible with your version of gnome shell
       To know your version of gnome-shell, type "gnome-shell --version".
       Make sure that version is in "shell-version" in the metadata.json file

 - It needs to be enabled. 
       gsettings list-recursively  org.gnome.shell
       gsettings get org.gnome.shell disabled-extensions
       gsettings get org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions
       gsettings reset org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions
       gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions "['extension-name@linuxmint.com']"

 - You need to restart Gnome Shell
       Alt+F2, and type "r"
       or from a command line: gnome-shell --replace

GNOME 3.2

3.1.90.1 is an early version of 3.2...
Gnome 3.2 introduces many changes.. and so almost all extensions written for previous versions of Gnome Shell are likely not to work :)

main() is replaced by init(), enabled(), disabled()... and there's many other changes as well ;)
